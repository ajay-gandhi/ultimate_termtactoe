# Ultimate TermTacToe

Ultimate TermTacToe is the next generation of Tic Tac Toe. Featuring all-new
gameplay, a refreshing interface, and strategy beyond imagination, Ultimate
TermTacToe tests the bounds of your thinking ability.

Lol, jk. It's really just regular Tic Tac Toe, but with 9 simultaneous boards.
Winning a single one of these mini boards is all fine and good, but to win the
entire game, you have to win a row, column, or diagonal of the major board.

## Playing

You have to have Node.js installed.

Clone the repo, install dependencies, then run `game.js`:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ajay-gandhi/ultimate_termtactoe.git
    $ cd ultimate_termtactoe
    $ npm install
    
    $ node game.js

Use the `arrow` keys to navigate through the boards and the `[spacebar]` to make
a move.

## Features

Right now, the game can only be played on a single computer with another human.
I'm thinking of adding these features though:

 * An AI for you to play against
 * A local server so that you can play against someone on another computer
